# collections.namedtuple()
# Basically, namedtuples are easy to create, lightweight object types.
# They turn tuples into convenient containers for simple tasks.
# With namedtuples, you donâ€™t have to use integer indices for accessing members of a tuple.

# TASK 
# Dr. John Wesley has a spreadsheet containing a list of student's ID's,MARKS ,CLASS  and NAME .
# Your task is to help Dr. Wesley calculate the average marks of the students.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer N, the total number of students.
# The second line contains the names of the columns in any order.
# The next N lines contains the Mark's,ID's,name and class, under their respective column names.

# Output Format
# Print the average marks of the list corrected to 2 decimal places.

# SOLN :

from collections import namedtuple

TotalStudents = int(input())

fields = input().split()

total = 0

for i in range(TotalStudents):
    students = namedtuple('student',fields)
    field1,field2,field3,field4 = input().split()
    student = students(field1,field2,field3,field4)
    total+=int(student.MARKS)
print('{:.2f}'.format(total/TotalStudents))
