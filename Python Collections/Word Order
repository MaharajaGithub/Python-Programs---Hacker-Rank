# TASK :

# You are given n words. Some words may repeat. For each word, output its number of occurrences. 
# The output order should correspond with the input order of appearance of the word. 
# Note: Each input line ends with a "\n" character.

# Input Format
# The first line contains the integer,n.
# The next n lines each contain a word.

# Output Format
# Output  lines.
# On the first line, output the number of distinct words from the input.
# On the second line, output the number of occurrences for each distinct word according to their appearance in the input.

# SOLN 1 :

from collections import Counter,OrderedDict

class OrderedCounter(Counter,OrderedDict):
    pass
d = OrderedCounter(input() for i in range(int(input())))
print(len(d))
print(*d.values())


from collections import OrderedDict
words = OrderedDict()


# SOLN 2 :

for i in range(int(input())):
    word = input()
    words.setdefault(word, 0)
    words[word] += 1
   
print(len(words))
print(*words.values())
