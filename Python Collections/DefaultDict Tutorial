# Defaultdict 

# The defaultdict tool is a container in the collections class of Python. It's similar to the usual dictionary (dict) container, 
# but the only difference is that a defaultdict will have a default value if that key has not been set yet. 
# If you didn't use a defaultdict you'd have to check to see if that key exists, and if it doesn't, set it to what you want.

# TASK :
# In this challenge, you will be given 2 integers, n and m. There are  words, which might repeat, in word group A.
# There are m words belonging to word group B. For each  words, check whether the word has appeared in group A or not. 
# Print the indices of each occurrence of m in group .A If it does not appear, print -1.

# Input Format
# The first line contains integers, n and m separated by a space.
# The next n lines contains the words belonging to group A.
# The next m lines contains the words belonging to group B.

# Output Format
# Output m lines.
# The Ith line should contain the 1-indexed positions of the occurrences of the Ith word separated by spaces.

#SOLN :

from collections import defaultdict

d = defaultdict(list)
list1 = []

n,m = map(int,input().split())

for i in range(0,n):
    d[input()].append(i+1)
for i in range(0,m):
    list1 = list1+[input()]
    
for i in list1:
    if i in d:
        print(" ".join(map(str,d[i])))
    else:
        print(-1)
