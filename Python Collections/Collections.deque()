# collections.deque()
# A deque is a double-ended queue. It can be used to add or remove elements from both ends.
# Deques support thread safe, memory efficient appends and pops from either side of the deque with approximately the same O(1) performance in either direction.

# TASK :
# Perform append, pop, popleft and appendleft methods on an empty deque d.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer N, the number of operations.
# The next N lines contains the space separated names of methods and their values.

# Output Format
# Print the space separated elements of deque d.


# SOLN 1 :

from collections import deque
N = int(input())
d = deque()
for i in range(N):
    cmd, *args = input().split()
    getattr(d,cmd)(*args)
[print(x,end=' ')for x in d]

# SOLN 2 :

from collections import deque
d = deque()
for _ in range(int(input())):
    inp = input().split()
    getattr(d, inp[0])(*[inp[1]] if len(inp) > 1 else [])
print(*[item for item in d])
