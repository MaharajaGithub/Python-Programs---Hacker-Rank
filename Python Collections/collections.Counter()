# collections.Counter()
# A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

# TASK

# Raghu is a shoe shop owner. His shop has X number of shoes.
# He has a list containing the size of each shoe he has in his shop.
# There are N number of customers who are willing to pay Xi amount of money only if they get the shoe of their desired size.
# Your task is to compute how much money Raghu earned.

# Input Format

# The first line contains X, the number of shoes.
# The second line contains the space separated list of all the shoe sizes in the shop.
# The third line contains N, the number of customers.
# The next N lines contain the space separated values of the Shoe size desired by the customer and Xi, the price of the shoe.

# Output Format
# Print the amount of money earned by Raghu.


# SOLN 1 :
