# TASK :
# You are given a set A and n other sets.
# Your job is to find whether set A is a strict superset of each of the N sets.
# Print True, if A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Otherwise, print False.
# A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.

# Input Format
# The first line contains the space separated elements of set A.
# The second line contains integer n, the number of other sets.
# The next n lines contains the space separated elements of the other sets.

# Output Format
# Print True if set A is a strict superset of all other N sets. Otherwise, print False.


# SOLN :

setA = set(input().split())
count = 0
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    setB = set(input().split())
    if setA.issuperset(setB):
        count+=1
print(count == n)

                # OR
                
setA = set(input().split())
print(all(setA > set(input().split()) for i in range(int(input()))))
