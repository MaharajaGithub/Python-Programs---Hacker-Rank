# TASK :

# There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers. 
# You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0.
# For each i integer in the array, if i3A, you add 1 to your happiness. If i3B, you add -1 to your happiness. 
# Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

# Input Format
# The first line contains integers n and m separated by a space.
# The second line contains n integers, the elements of the array.
# The third and fourth lines contain m integers, A and B, respectively.

# Output Format
# Output a single integer, your total happiness.


# SOLN:

n, m = input().split()

sc_ar = input().split()

A = set(input().split())
B = set(input().split())
print (sum([(i in A) - (i in B) for i in sc_ar]))
