# Given a list of rational numbers,find their product.

# Concept
# The reduce() function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively on a list of objects in succession from left to right to reduce it to one value. 
# Say you have a list, say [1,2,3] and you have to find its sum.

# Input Format
# First line contains n, the number of rational numbers.
# The ith of next n lines contain two integers each, the numerator(Ni) and denominator(Di) of the ith rational number in the list.

# Output Format
# Print only one line containing the numerator and denominator of the product of the numbers in the list in its simplest form, 
# i.e. numerator and denominator have no common divisor other than 1.

# SOLN :

from fractions import Fraction
from functools import reduce
import operator

def product(fracs):
    t = reduce(operator.mul , fracs)
    return t.numerator, t.denominator
