#  Mr. Vincent works in a door mat manufacturing company. One day, he designed a new door mat with the following specifications:

# Mat size must be n X m (n is an odd natural number,and m is 3 times n .)
# The design should have 'WELCOME' written in the center.
# The design pattern should only use |, . and - characters.


# SOLN :

n, m = map(int,input().split())

pattern = [('.|.'*(2*i + 1)).center(m, '-') for i in range(n//2)]

print('\n'.join(pattern + ['WELCOME'.center(m, '-')] + pattern[::-1]))
