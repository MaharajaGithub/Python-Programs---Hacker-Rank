# TASK :

# The provided code stub will read in a dictionary containing key/value pairs of name:[marks] for a list of students. 
# Print the average of the marks array for the student name provided, showing 2 places after the decimal.

# Input Format

# The first line contains the integer n, the number of students' records. The next n lines contain the names and marks obtained by a student, 
# each value separated by a space. The final line contains query_name, the name of a student to query.

# Output Format

# Print one line: The average of the marks obtained by the particular student correct to 2 decimal places.

# Soln :

n = int(input())
