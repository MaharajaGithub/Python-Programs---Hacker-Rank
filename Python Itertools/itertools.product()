#  itertools.product()

# This tool computes the cartesian product of input iterables.
# It is equivalent to nested for-loops.
# For example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).

# TASK :
# You are given a two lists A and B. Your task is to compute their cartesian product A * B.

# Input Format
# The first line contains the space separated elements of list A.
# The second line contains the space separated elements of list B.
# Both lists have no duplicate integer elements.

# Output Format
# Output the space separated tuples of the cartesian product.


# SOLN :

from itertools import product

A = list(map(int,input().split()))
B = list(map(int,input().split()))

print(*product(A,B))

                # OR

import itertools

A = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
B = [int(y) for y in input().split()]

print(*itertools.product(A, B))
