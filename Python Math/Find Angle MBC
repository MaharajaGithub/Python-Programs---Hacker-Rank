# TASK :
# You are given the lengths AB and BC.
# Your task is to find MBC(angle 0 degrees, as shown in the figure) in degrees.

# Input Format
# The first line contains the length of side AB.
# The second line contains the length of side BC.

# Output Format
# Output MBC in degrees.

# SOLN:




import math
AB = int(input())
BC = int(input())

hype = math.hypot(AB,BC)                          #to calculate hypotenuse

res = round(math.degrees(math.acos(BC/hype)))     #to calculate required angle 

degree = chr(176)                                 #for DEGREE symbol

print(res,degree,sep = '')
