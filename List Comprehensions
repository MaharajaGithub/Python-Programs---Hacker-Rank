#Let's learn about list comprehensions! 

#TASK :

#You are given three integers x,y and z representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer n. 
#Print a list of all possible coordinates given by (i,j,k) on a 3D grid where the sum of i+j+k is not equal to .

#Use list comprehension to solve this.


x = int(input())
y = int(input())
z = int(input())
n = int(input())
    
print ([[a,b,c] for a in range(0,x+1) for b in range(0,y+1) for c in range(0,z+1) if a + b + c != n ])
