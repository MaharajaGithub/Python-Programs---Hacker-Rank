# zip([iterable, ...])
# This function returns a list of tuples. The th tuple contains the th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables.
# If the argument sequences are of unequal lengths, then the returned list is truncated to the length of the shortest argument sequence.

# TASK :
# The National University conducts an examination of N students in X subjects.
# Your task is to compute the average scores of each student.

# Input Format
# The first line contains N and X separated by a space.
# The next X lines contains the space separated marks obtained by students in a particular subject.

# Output Format
# Print the averages of all students on separate lines.
# The averages must be correct up to 1 decimal place.


# SOLN :

N,X = map(int,input().split())

sheet = []
for i in range(X):
    sheet.append(map(float,input().split()))
for j in zip(*sheet):
    print(sum(j)/len(j))
