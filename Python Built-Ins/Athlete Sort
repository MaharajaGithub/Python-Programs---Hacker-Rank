# TASK :
# You are given a spreadsheet that contains a list of N athletes and their details (such as age, height, weight and so on). 
# You are required to sort the data based on the Kth attribute and print the final resulting table. 

# Input Format
# The first line contains N and M separated by a space.
# The next N lines each contain M elements.
# The last line contains K.

# Output Format
# Print the N lines of the sorted table. Each line should contain the space separated elements. Check the sample below for clarity.

# SOLN 1 :

n, m = map(int, input().split())
nums = [list(map(int, input().split())) for i in range(n)]
k = int(input())

nums.sort(key=lambda x: x[k])

for line in nums:
    print(*line, sep=' ')
    
# SOLN 2 :

N, M = map(int, input().split())
rows = [input() for _ in range(N)]
K = int(input())

for row in sorted(rows, key=lambda row: int(row.split()[K])):
    print(row)
